            <center> <h1> Reason why this game is made? </h1>
            <p> Well, the main reason why this game's made is because I need a good grade to finish my technical college, but it's also made cause I'm really interested in video games, and I'd love to try making my own game! </p>
            <p> Don't expect a game that is better than today's games, but instead, expect a average game with average graphics made by a average student. </p>
